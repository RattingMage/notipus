## Architecture

The service is built with a modular architecture that separates concerns and makes it easy to extend:

- `app/providers/`: Payment provider webhook handlers (Shopify, Chargify)
- `app/insights.py`: Customer insights and recommendations
- `app/event_processor.py`: Event processing and notification formatting
- `app/models.py`: Common data models and enums
- `app/__init__.py`: Flask application and webhook handlers

## Docker Deployment

The service is containerized using Docker for easy deployment. The Dockerfile:
- Uses Python 3.9 slim base image
- Installs Poetry for dependency management
- Copies only necessary files
- Sets up a non-root user for security
- Exposes port 8080
- Uses multi-stage build for smaller image size

Environment variables are passed to the container at runtime, making it easy to deploy in different environments without modifying the code.
