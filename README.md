## Architecture

The service is built with a modular architecture that separates concerns and makes it easy to extend:

- `app/providers/`: Payment provider implementations (Shopify, Chargify)
- `app/enrichment.py`: Notification enrichment with context and insights
- `app/messages.py`: Message generation with whimsical templates
- `app/models.py`: Common data models and enums
- `app/main.py`: Flask application and webhook handlers

## Docker Deployment

The service is containerized using Docker for easy deployment. The Dockerfile:
- Uses Python 3.9 slim base image
- Installs Poetry for dependency management
- Copies only necessary files
- Sets up a non-root user for security
- Exposes port 8080
- Uses multi-stage build for smaller image size

Environment variables are passed to the container at runtime, making it easy to deploy in different environments without modifying the code.
